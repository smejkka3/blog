# Embarking on a Half Marathon Journey: From Gym Enthusiast to Runner

As someone who's spent the past decade hitting the gym, with a recent two-year stint in CrossFit, the idea of running a half marathon seemed like an exhilarating challenge. I'll admit, I'm not a seasoned runner, but I'm not overweight, and I've maintained a decent level of fitness. It was a friend, who, just over a year ago, transitioned from weights to running shoes, that inspired me to take the plunge. And so, armed with a brand-new pair of running shoes, I embarked on a 9-month training plan crafted by Chat GPT.

### Week 1: Building the Foundation

The journey kicked off with a focus on form and easing into the rhythm of running. With two runs per week, I managed to maintain a comfortable pace under 7 minutes per kilometer. The gym sessions were a blend of full-body workouts with an emphasis on low weights and high repetitions. It's crucial to strike a balance, especially for someone like me, with muscles accustomed to weight training.

### Week 2: Finding My Stride

As I transitioned into the second week, I could feel the initial twinges of progress. The long run, lasting between 45 to 60 minutes, was a testament to my body's adaptability. My endurance was improving, and I could hold a consistent pace. The gym session was a welcome change, focusing on strength without overexertion. The rope jumping sessions, however, were a different story. I'll admit, I've never been a fan of jumping, but I'm determined to master the technique.

With a steady eye on the calendar, I'm aware that this journey is a marathon in itself, not a sprint. The half marathon in April 2024 feels both achievable and within reach. It's not about breaking records, but about breaking personal barriers and proving that with dedication, even a gym enthusiast can transform into a runner.

So, to anyone considering taking up a similar challenge, my advice is simple: trust the process, listen to your body, and don't be afraid to push your limits. The road to a half marathon may be long, but every step is a victory, and every milestone is a testament to your strength, both physically and mentally.

Stay tuned for the next update on this transformative journey from weights to kilometers, as I continue to lace up and hit the pavement, one stride at a time.

### Update: Week 3-4 (September 23 - October 6, 2023):

**Running:** Extending my running time to 30-40 minutes has been challenging, but the autumnal winds and the beautiful changing leaves are motivation enough. With every step, I remind myself of the end goal: a successful half marathon. The Thursday runs, in particular, have become my time to introspect, to take in nature, and to push myself just a tad bit more.

**Gym Sessions:** I've continued my strength training, adding a few more reps here and there. The squats, lunges, and especially the core exercises, are slowly but surely becoming my best friends. Who knew the path to a marathon also leads to toned abs?

**Rope Jumping:** The rope and I, we've come to an understanding. I've finally started enjoying my sessions, focusing more on the rhythm and less on tripping. The added bonus? It's excellent cardio that complements my running sessions.

**New Addition - Foam Rolling:** This, my friends, has been a game-changer. Post-run, I've taken to foam rolling, focusing on my calves and hamstrings. The relief is immediate and incredibly satisfying. If you've never tried it, I can't recommend it enough.

**Feelings & Reflections:** The overarching sentiment at this stage? Excitement mixed with a tinge of nervousness. The commitment to train every day, to wake up even when the bed feels incredibly inviting, is what's testing me more than the physical exertion.

**Goals for the next weeks:** As I inch closer to the end of the month, my goals are set. I aim to master that 40-minute run without a break, fine-tune my rope jumping technique, and perhaps, just perhaps, indulge in a cheeky cheat meal (or two!).

Stay tuned, everyone. The journey continues, and as always, your support and kind words propel me forward. Here's to more miles, more stories, and that ultimate finish line.


### Update: Week 5-13 (Ocober 7 - December 2, 2023):

## A Rollercoaster Month: From Brazil to Berlin, Challenges and Comebacks

---

The past month has been nothing short of a rollercoaster ride. I packed my bags and jetted off to Brazil, armed with the determination to continue my half marathon training while immersing myself in the vibrant Brazilian culture. However, as fate would have it, my journey took an unexpected turn.

### Running Woes

Eager to maintain my running momentum, I started the first week in Brazil with a plan to run 5 km four times a week. The scenic routes were captivating, but after a series of runs, my right knee began protesting vehemently. It seems the impact of running combined with the unforgiving pavements didn't sit well with my body. Perhaps my muscular frame was a bit too heavy for the constant pounding.

### A Jumping Switch

In an attempt to salvage my cardio goals, I pivoted to a rope jumping program using an app called Crossrope. The initial excitement, however, was short-lived as my right knee pain escalated. Despite reducing the intensity, after a week, I had to make a tough call and cease all jumping activities.

### Brazilian Cuisine Temptations

Adding salt to the wound (or perhaps sugar to the injury), the irresistible allure of Brazilian cuisine proved too tempting to resist. My diet, which was diligently maintained during the initial weeks of my training, took a nosedive. It was a feast of flavors, but not exactly the fuel my body needed.

### Fitness Retreat

Coupled with the dietary detour, my fitness journey took an unexpected retreat. A sedentary lifestyle in Brazil, combined with the abrupt halt to my exercise routine, set me back considerably. The vibrant energy of the country clashed with my temporarily muted fitness aspirations.

### Health Woes

Returning to Berlin in the middle of November, my health threw another curveball. A few days before my departure from Brazil, I found myself grappling with viral conjunctivitis. The uncomfortable eye condition intensified during the flight, rendering me practically housebound for the subsequent three weeks.

### Slow But Steady Comeback

Emerging from the health setback, I cautiously resumed my fitness routine. The initial weeks involved a combination of CrossFit three times a week, gym sessions twice a week, and the occasional run when the weather permitted. It was a slow but steady return to the regimen I had diligently crafted before the unexpected hurdles.

### A Glimmer of Hope

As the Christmas season approaches, I'm hopeful that the worst is behind me. The setbacks were unforeseen and challenging, but they've only fueled my determination to reclaim my fitness journey. The holiday season, notorious for indulgences, presents an opportunity to strike a balance between festive cheer and disciplined training.

In the grand narrative of a half marathon preparation, this month has been a subplot of challenges, setbacks, and comebacks. The road to fitness is seldom a straight line, but rather a mosaic of twists and turns. As I lace up my shoes and face the winter winds, I'm reminded that the journey is just as important as the destination.

Stay tuned for the next chapter of this marathon adventure, where I navigate the festive season and push the boundaries of resilience. Until then, here's to running, jumping, and embracing the unpredictable journey toward the half marathon finish line!


### Update: Week 14-29 (December 2, 2023 - March 16, 2024):

## A Chilly Interlude: Snowy Czechia and the Battle with Injury

---

After bidding farewell to the vibrant energy of Brazil and the unexpected health setbacks, I found myself back in the cozy embrace of my family in Czechia. But as the winter settled in, so did the frosty temperatures and blankets of snow, creating a picturesque yet challenging backdrop for my training.

## Frozen Roads and Hibernating Shoes

The allure of running against the backdrop of a winter wonderland was undeniable, but the reality of icy pavements and sub-zero temperatures posed a formidable challenge. Despite my best intentions, I found myself reluctant to brave the elements, opting instead for the warmth and comfort of indoor spaces.

## A Structured Restart

As the new year dawned, so did a renewed sense of determination. I crafted a structured training plan, designed to gradually ease me back into my running routine while accommodating the wintry conditions. Two short runs during the week, each spanning 5 kilometers, complemented by a longer run on Sundays, double the distance.

## Battling the Chill

Motivation became my steadfast companion as I ventured out into the frosty air, my breath forming misty clouds as I pounded the frozen ground beneath me. The biting cold tested my resolve, but with each step, I felt a sense of accomplishment and progress, despite the numbing sensation creeping into my extremities.

## A Painful Setback

However, just as the momentum of progress began to build, a familiar foe reared its head once more. My right knee, seemingly recovered from its earlier woes, began to protest with renewed vigor. The sharp twinges of pain served as a sobering reminder of the fragility of the human body, particularly when subjected to the rigors of training.

## CrossFit to the Rescue

With a heavy heart, I made the difficult decision to halt my running endeavors and redirect my focus towards strengthening and rehabilitating my injured knee. CrossFit became my sanctuary, offering a diverse array of exercises to challenge and fortify my body, all while minimizing the strain on my compromised joint.

## Patience and Persistence

As the weeks stretched into months, I remained steadfast in my commitment to recovery. Each session at the gym was a testament to my resilience and determination, a silent vow to overcome adversity and emerge stronger than before. Though the road ahead was fraught with uncertainty, I refused to let setbacks define my journey.

## A Glimpse of Spring

Finally, as the last vestiges of winter began to fade, so too did the persistent ache in my knee. With cautious optimism, I tentatively reintroduced running into my routine, taking care to listen to my body and heed its signals. The thawing landscape mirrored the gradual thawing of my fears and doubts, paving the way for a triumphant return to the roads and trails that had once been my sanctuary.

## Embracing the Journey

As I reflect on the tumultuous months that have passed, I am reminded of the invaluable lessons learned along the way. The path to progress is rarely linear, often fraught with obstacles and setbacks that test our resolve and resilience. Yet, it is precisely through these challenges that we discover the depths of our strength and determination.

## Looking Ahead

With spring on the horizon and the promise of new beginnings in the air, I eagerly anticipate the next chapter of my marathon journey. Armed with newfound wisdom and a renewed sense of purpose, I stand ready to embrace whatever challenges lie ahead, confident in my ability to conquer them with grace and perseverance.

Join me as I continue to chase my dreams, one step at a time, towards the elusive finish line of the half marathon. Until then, here's to the unwavering spirit of resilience and the enduring beauty of the journey itself.
