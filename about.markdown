Computer Science Graduate from Technische Universität Berlin, data scientist and data engineer specialising in machine learning. I have acquired a wealth of theoretical and practical expertise from working in a real-estate startup and through my Master’s candidature in computer science at Technische Universität Berlin. At the moment I am especially interested in autonomous driving, deep learning implementation and research applications of state of the art computer vision systems. I am passionate about building intelligent, autonomous systems and new technologies to improve outcomes for future generations.
