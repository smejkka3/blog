As a highly experienced Data Engineer with a Master's degree in Cognitive Algorithms, I bring a wealth of theoretical and practical expertise to every project I work on. Throughout my career, I have honed my skills by working in a real-estate startup and through my Master's candidature in computer science at Technische Universit√§t Berlin.

I am known for my ability to think creatively, approach programming objectively, and quickly learn new technologies and programming languages. My specialties include developing ML and CV programs, as well as designing and implementing ETL/ELT pipelines. In my programming toolkit, I am well-versed in Python, C++, and Java. Additionally, I have a deep understanding of SQL, Docker, AWS, and PySpark.

Not only do I excel in software development, but I also have experience working with robotics systems and algorithms, including ROS and SLAM. I believe that these skills, coupled with my strong problem-solving abilities, make me a valuable asset to any team.

Throughout my career, I have achieved several notable accomplishments, such as developing a highly-efficient ETL pipeline using PySpark and designing an ML program that significantly improved data accuracy and analysis. I take pride in my work and strive for excellence in everything I do.

When I'm not working, you can find me exploring the outdoors or engaging in activities that challenge me mentally and physically. I believe in living life to the fullest and bringing that same energy to every project I work on.

I am passionate about technology and its potential to change the world. I am excited to collaborate with like-minded individuals and companies that are looking to push the boundaries of what's possible. If you're interested in working together or discussing any projects, please don't hesitate to reach out.
