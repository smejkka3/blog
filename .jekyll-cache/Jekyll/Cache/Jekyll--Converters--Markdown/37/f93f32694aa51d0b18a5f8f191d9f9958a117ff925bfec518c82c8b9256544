<p>The next assignment after the ROS introductory is create a node which uses laser_scan data and prevents the car from collision
into nearby objects. This is achieved by computing TTC (Time To Collision) using before mentioned LaserScan message. This assignment
checks more into the depth the ability work with publishers and subscribe and forces me to explore more Odometry message and
AckermannDriveStamped message because both of them are used to prevent the collision. But first let‚Äôs look at some theory.</p>

<h2 id="aeb-automatic-emergency-braking">AEB (Automatic Emergency Braking)</h2>

<p>AEB is simply forcing stop before expected collision with nearby object. It is a safety reaction of the car based on the
information it is gathering from its sensors. It is simple binary classification problem which answers question break/not break.</p>

<h4 id="failures">Failures</h4>

<p>The big problem in AEB is false negative. This means the car won‚Äôt stop when it is about to collide with an obstacle. As you can imagine no one will deploy a car which can‚Äôt avoid collision or even can kill people. Another, but not as serious problem are false positives, when car stops randomly when it should not and there is no danger of colliding.</p>

<h4 id="ttc-time-to-collision">TTC (Time to Collision)</h4>

<p>Let‚Äôs explain how TTC is calculated:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/TTC_formula.png" />
  Time to Collision formula from <a href="https://f1tenth.org/learn.html">lecture 2</a> of F1/10 course</p>

<p>where denominator that‚Äôs time derivative of range between vehicle and given obstacle, also called as ‚Äúrange rate‚Äù is defined as:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/range_rate.png" />
  Formula  for range-rate from <a href="https://f1tenth.org/learn.html">lecture 2</a> of F1/10 course</p>

<h4 id="lidar">Lidar</h4>

<p>Although I have worked with lidar in previous assignment, it worths explaining the <a href="http://docs.ros.org/en/api/sensor_msgs/html/msg/LaserScan.htmlLaserScan">LaserScan message data fields</a>
I will have to use in this assignment. Based on the TTC formula above, I‚Äôm gonna need <i>float32[] ranges</i> to calculate distance between obstacle and the car, which is numerator in the the TTC formula.
For denominator (range-rate) I have to use all <i>float32 angle_min, float32 angle_max and float32 angle_increment</i>. That‚Äôs because for range-rate computation I need cosine of each beam angle (with these 3 variables
I can get every single angle of my LaserScan data). Also as mentioned I need to take max of given range-rate of given beam and 0 so meaning if range-range for specific beam is less than 0, assign it 0. In both of my nodes (Python and C++) to avoid division by 0 I set this value very close
to 0. I was trying to remove 0 from denominator completely together with numerator at the same index (same LaserScan angle), however this caused lot of false negatives.</p>

<p>Another message I need is <i>Odometry</i>, specifically <i>geometry_msgs/TwistWithCovariance twist.linear.x</i>, which is linear speed of my car, used
again in the range-rate calculation.</p>

<p>TTC threshold for braking was set to 0.3 according to my own experimentation on the RViz simulator. When TTC is less than this threshold, the brake is applied.
My final package as required in the task is available bellow.</p>
