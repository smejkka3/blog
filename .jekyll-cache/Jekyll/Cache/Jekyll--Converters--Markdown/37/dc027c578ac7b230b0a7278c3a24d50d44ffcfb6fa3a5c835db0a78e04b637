I"Ö<p>The project Iâ€™m going to be working on is object tracking using LiDAR initially.</p>

<h2 id="description-of-tasks">Description of tasks</h2>
<p>Robust object tracking and localization is a critical need for autonomous cars, allowing for safe,
intelligent navigation and planning. Cars must be able to perform this task rapidly and accurately,
requiring algorithms with high output frequencies and low false-negative and false positive rates.
While much work has been done on object tracking and localization with full-scale cars, the</p>

<p>F1Tenth Object Tracking project seeks to implement tracking on the F1Tenth autonomous race-
car system. Initially, this project will build on the work of Dr. Anna Petrovskaya, who proposed a</p>

<p>LiDAR-based object tracking system that integrates geometric and dynamic knowledge of
tracked vehicles in a Bayes filter to increase object tracking accuracy. This project will
implement and test her proposed system on the F1Tenth vehicle, making use of its onboard 2D
LiDAR. Later, I will combine LiDAR-based tracking with visual tracking, in order to increase
the robustness of the system by increasing the signal-noise ratio from the vehicleâ€™s sensors.
Given the restrictions posed by the pandemic, this project will heavily leverage virtual
environments like RViz and the F1Tenth teamâ€™s proprietary gym environment. If possible, I will
attempt to implement my system on the actual F1Tenth car for further real-life testing and
validation.</p>
