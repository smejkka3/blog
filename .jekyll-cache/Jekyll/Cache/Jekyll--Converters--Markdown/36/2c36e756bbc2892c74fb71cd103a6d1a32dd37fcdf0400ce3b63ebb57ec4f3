<p>Moving away from reactive methods to different approach to autonomy and thatâ€™s utilising mapping information around the car. This method is called Simultaneous Localization and Mapping or for short SLAM. Iâ€™m going to describe some building blocks for SLAM such as Occupancy grid maps, itâ€™s relation to Scan matching and also describe some of the basic SLAM algorithms out there and how they work.</p>
