<p>Let’s describe alternative approach to wallfollowing, which is just following left or right hand-side boundary of track. The Follow the Gap algorithm instead tracing the boundary is navigating trough the track without colliding to any static obstacle and finding the best path to avoid these obstacles. The wallfollowing is not completely able to solve all challenges coming with having the obstacles in the track, which are different shape. Follow the gap is simple algorithm which doesn’t need a lot fo information about the track before-hand, but using the data acquired right now, known as reactive method. It is able to avoid any obstacles without any prior knowledge about the map.</p>
