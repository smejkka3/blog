<p>Last post was about SLAM, where I introduced approach to localization, here we are going to look at approach to lacalization using sets of range measurements collected over across time. Going back, localization is state of robot with respect to the environment it find self in. One approach to localization is to use odometry, basically estimating the current pose of the robot from knowing a start position and integration of control and motion measurements. However there is accumulation of very small errors in the position of the robot which becomes issue over some extended period time and the uncertainty of the pose increases. One way to solve this is to use range sensor measurements to localize, also known as scan matching.</p>

<h2 id="setting-a-problem">Setting a Problem</h2>
<p>Having a scan from robot of measurements of distances to some landmarks A,B,C in some environment, we call this measurements at t=0 distances in local frame of reference. When we move in unknown direction at time t=1, the distances are obviously going to change. We can measure these distances at time t=1 and we want find transform R which transforms the two set of points to be the closest and this transform represents how much the robot moved. This is visualised on the picture bellow for better intuition ( ref <a href="https://f1tenth.org/learn.html">module C, lecture 9 F1Tenth website</a>)
