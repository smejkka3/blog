<p>As already mentioned, the purpose of coarse association is for algorithm to get and idea which objects in the current LiDAR scan belongs to already existing objects and static background. It is based on modified version Iterative Closest Point Algorithm (ICP) [6], which we are going to describe more closely in this section.
ICP is efficient algorithm for minimizing the difference between two clusters of points. In robotics it is mainly used for reconstructing 2D or 3D surfaces from different scans, to localize robots and achieve optimal path planning [10]. In our work we use it to align two clusters within certain distance threshold and compute rough guess of the rigid transformation between target and source clusters. If both translation and rotation between these two clusters are lower than very small, fixed threshold within multiple iteration, we say the the target cluster is corresponding to the source cluster. ICP can be very slow if we have big initial misalignment between target and source, however with scanning frequency of out LiDAR 40Hz we are making sure that the distance and misalignment between two objects canâ€™t be so high that ICP would fail to converge quickly, given our prediction model is correct as the ICP is run right after the prediction step. The changes we have made to original ICP and the pseudo-algorithm of coarse association are described in section 5.4. The resulting transformation between found point pairs from target and source cluster is done by scikit-image library using Euclidean Transformation. The result of our associations computed by ICP on clusters from figure 4 is shown figures 5.</p>
