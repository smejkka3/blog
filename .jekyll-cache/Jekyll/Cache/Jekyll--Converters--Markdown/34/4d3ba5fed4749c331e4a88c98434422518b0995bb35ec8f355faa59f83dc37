<p>Let’s describe alternative approach to wallfollowing, which is just following left or right hand-side boundary of track. The Follow the Gap algorithm instead tracing the boundary is navigating trough the track without colliding to any static obstacle and finding the best path to avoid these obstacles. The wallfollowing is not completely able to solve all challenges coming with having the obstacles in the track, which are different shape. Follow the gap is simple algorithm which doesn’t need a lot fo information about the track before-hand, but using the data acquired right now, known as reactive method. It is able to avoid any obstacles without any prior knowledge about the map.</p>

<h4 id="reactive-navigation">Reactive navigation</h4>
<p>Reactive navigation is using immediate sensory input to decide the driving steering and velocity commands. This works for statics and in some cases also dynamic obstacles.</p>

<h3 id="gap-finding-intuition">Gap finding intuition</h3>
<p>As the name of algorithm suggests, the car should be able to find a widest gap in the presence of immediate obstacles and drive into this gap to avoid any immediate collision. Let’s say my lidar is reporting following array of distances [0.2, 6.2, 6.0, 7.0, inf, 3.0, inf, 3.0, inf, 8.0, 1.0, 3.0] you could simply choose the farthest distance obstacle and drive towards it, however this may not be possible as the car would have to pass between too obstacles which range between them is not enough for car to fit in ( there is enough room in between than - this can be computed by computing length of the arc given the angular measurements), or the angle between these obstacles is not physically possible for car to turn - as in my array is case of 7th element. To approach this problem let’s define what a gap is:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The gap is series of at least n consecutive hits that pass some distance threshold t.</li>
</ul>

<p>If we would apply this definition to the array given above with n = 3 and t = 5.0 we would get only one gap: [6.2, 6.0, 7.0, inf]. So we would steer towards the center of this gap.</p>

<p>Problems with this approach is that purely following the deepest gap allows the car pass between the obstacles as the car might not fit in between them. To address this challenge we can use approach use in all of robotics.</p>

<h4 id="point-robot-approach">Point Robot Approach</h4>
<p>We can assume that the robot is circular. With this assumption we can inflate the  the obstacles with the radius of robot. So if I want the robot go between the obstacles I can always represent the robot as point object and still assure that the robot will fit between the two obstacles as I’m clearing the obstacles by at least the radius of robot itself. This is better dhown on figure bellow (source: <a href="https://linklab-uva.github.io/autonomousracing/assets/files/L14-Follow-the-gap.pdf">UV lecture follow the gap</a>):

<h4 id="disparity">Disparity</h4>
<p>Looking trough the lidar readings for consecutive readings that differ by an amount over some threshold, than we mask these readings  to appear closer to the lidar. The reminding points which are farther than the mask are the actual points where the car can fit and drive trough. This concept is nicely visualised on the following figure from <a href="https://linklab-uva.github.io/autonomousracing/assets/files/L14-Follow-the-gap.pdf">UV lecture follow the gap</a>
